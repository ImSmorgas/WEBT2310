                <p>Welcome! Blood, sweat & tears went into building my company and I’m
                    glad I get to finally share it with all of you! My name is Ashleigh
                    and I have been a hairstylist for 12 years. I am passionate and
                    talented customizing clients hair through their personal needs,
                    wants, and maintenance goals. I believe no two haircuts should
                    be cut the same. This goes for my male and female clientele.
                    Through continuing education and building my technical skills
                    I have been able to work on all types of hair. My biggest goals
                    involve self growth and being the best, detailed barber I can
                    be professionally behind the chair. I hope to show all my
                    clients it’s possible to look polished all while enjoying
                    a relaxing barbershop experience. I am laid back, sarcastic,
                    down to earth and professional. People say Im a great
                    listener and give the best scalp massage. My high standards
                    keep me leveling up in life, and my humor keeps me grounded. In the
                    end I am here to take this industry to a new level, come join me.</p>
